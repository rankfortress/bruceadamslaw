	<h1>Bruce Adams Law Office</h1>
	<p>
	Hello, I am Bruce Adams, born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. After graduating from The University of Alabama, I was commissioned as an officer in the United States Army, serving as a military police officer. While in the reserves, I earned my law degree from the Cumberland Law School at Samford University. I went on active duty and served as a Judge Advocate at Fort McClellan.In 1984, I began private practice here in Anniston, Alabama, where I have lived and practiced since. My practice has involved many types of legal matters, includingestates, business litigation, personal injury, and divorce. Now, I concentrate on estate, probate, business matters, and family law.

	Over many years I have handled many claims, death claims or business torts. Unlike some of the billboard and T.V. lawyers who may just hand your file to a young associate, your case will receive my attention
